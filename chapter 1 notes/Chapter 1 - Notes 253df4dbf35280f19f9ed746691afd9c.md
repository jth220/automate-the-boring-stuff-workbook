# Chapter 1 - Notes

The learning outcomes and what the author is expecting from this chapter

- This book tells you that you can ignore syntactical constructions, library functions and development environment features and only teaches you the basics to start creating **scripts**
- using a interactive shell (aka REPL, read-evaluate-print-loop) lets you run python instructions one at a time with instant results, which is great for on the go learning.

Expressions

- basic programming instruction
- consist of values and operators and can be evaluated (reduced) to a single value
- single values with no operators are also considered an expression

in otherwords

**Expressions are made of values and operators, and when Python evaluates an expression, it reduces it to a single value**

**Jupyter Notebook uses an editor with this kind of interactive shell**

Data Types are categories of values, and a value belongs to exactly one data type.

Variables - Name that stores a value

variables are initialised the first time a value is stored, can be used in epxressions

when a variable is assigned a new value, is is overwritten

Remember that statements are instructions python executes, unlike expressions it doesnâ€™t necessarily produce a value

Expression are pieces of code that evaluates to a single value, made up of values, variables and operators
